# Concepts

## Identity Verification Flow
For a typical application, the flow for identifying and verifying a new user will be as follows:

1. The Endpass Connect library is triggered by a Javascript method call or the user's click on a "Login With Endpass" button.
2. The user is prompted to log in to their Endpass account in a new window. If the user does not have an Endpass account, they will be able to create one without leaving your application.
3. The user is shown a permissions dialog to approve access to the scopes requested by your application.
4. The user is prompted to upload any additional documents needed to verify additional scopes.
5. The user's documents are instantly verified by the Endpass backend.
6. The Endpass Connect Javascript library returns a Promise with the data requested.
7. Your server-side application retrieves additional user information, like document data and verification status.

## Scopes
Scopes represent the information you are requesting from a user.
Scopes must be explicitly defined when the Endpass Connect library is initialized.

When the user clicks the "Login With Endpass" button, a permissions dialog with the requested scopes will be shown to the user.

Try to request the minimal number of scopes required for your application. Users are more likely to agree to a smaller set of permissions.

### List of Scopes

|Scope   |Description|
|---------|-----------|
|**user:email:read**|Get the user's email address|
|**user:address:read**|Get all of a user's physical addresses with verification status|
|**user:phone:read**|Get all of the user's phone numbers with verification status|
|**user:data:read**|Get personal info about user|
|**documents:status:read**|Get the verification status of all of the user's identity documents|
|**documents:data:read**|Get all of the data, like name, number, and expiration date from all of the user's identity documents|
|**documents:image:read**|Get the actual identity document images submitted by the user|
|**wallet:address:read**|Get the user's primary cryptocurrency address|
|**wallet:accounts:read**|Get all cryptocurrency addresses in the user's wallet|

Most applications will only need the <strong>documents:status:read</strong> scope to get document verification status without requesting the actual documents.

## Documents
Documents represent the identity documents submitted by the user. After a document is submitted, it is automatically verified by Endpass AI technology. You do not need to verify that a document is valid if it has the "Verified" status.
