# Concepts

## Scopes
Scopes represent the information you are requesting from a user.
Scopes must be explicitly defined when the Endpass Connect library is initialized.

When the user clicks the "Login With Endpass" button, a permissions dialog with the requested scopes will be shown to the user.

Try to request the minimal number of scopes required for your application. Users are more likely to agree to a smaller set of permissions.

### List of Scopes

|Scope   |Description|
|---------|-----------|
|**user:email:read**|Get the user's email address|
|**user:address:read**|Get all of a user's physical addresses with verification status|
|**user:phone:read**|Get all of the user's phone numbers with verification status|
|**documents:status:read**|Get the verification status of all of the user's identity documents|
|**documents:data:read**|Get all of the data, like name, number, and expiration date from all of the user's identity documents|
|**documents:image:read**|Get the actual identity document images submitted by the user|
|**wallet:address:read**|Get the user's primary cryptocurrency address|
|**wallet:accounts:read**|Get all cryptocurrency addresses in the user's wallet|

<aside class="notice">
Most applications will only need the <strong>documents:status:read</strong> scope to get document verification status without requesting the actual documents.

## Documents
Documents represent the identity documents submitted by the user. After a document is submitted, it is automatically verified by Endpass AI technology. You do not need to verify that a document is valid if it has the "Verified" status.
