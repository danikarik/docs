# Introduction

Welcome to the Endpass API documentation.

You can use our [Server API](#server-api) to access endpoints, which can get information about Endpass [users](#user).

[Endpass Connect](#endpass-connect-client) client - javascript library for more convenient use in front-end development.

We have language bindings in Shell and JavaScript. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
