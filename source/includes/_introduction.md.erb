# Introduction

Endpass Connect makes it easy for developers to verify a user's identity.

The Endpass platform contains two main components:

- [**Endpass Connect**](#endpass-connect-client) client: A javascript library for your application you can use to let users sign in and request their identity information.
- [**Server API**](#server-api): server-side API to get information about a user and their verification status

All Endpass APIs are built on oAuth2 standards, and will be easy to use for developers who are familiar with building oAuth clients.
