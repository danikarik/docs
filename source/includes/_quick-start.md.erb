[Example App](https://endpass.github.io/connect-demo/#/examples)

## 2. Add Endpass Connect Library

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_install.md.erb" %>
<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-script.md.erb" %>

Add the library to your application using the npm or script tag method.

## 3. Request User Information

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_quick-start.md.erb" %>

Initialize a new instance of the client with the scopes required for your
application.

Call the `connect.request` method to request information from the user.
This method will open a window allowing the user to log in and grant
permissions based on your application.

For example, `connect.request('/user')` will return  a promise with [basic user information](#user).
