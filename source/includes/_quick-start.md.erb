# Quick start

A quick start example of using the [Endpass Connect](#endpass-connect-client) library in your web app.

[Example App](https://endpass.github.io/connect-demo/#/examples)

## 1. Register Application

Visit the [Endpass dashboard](https://vault.endpass.com/#/apps) and create a new application.

Save your Client ID for use later in this tutorial.

[More about application registration](#application-registration)

## 2. Add Endpass Connect Library

## 3. Request User Information

Call the `connect.request` method to request information from the user.

## Library integration

There are two way to install Endpass connect in your application: use CDN integration or modular integrations for implementing the modular structure.

### WAY 1: CDN integration

If you want to integrate library via script tag just use provided CDN links

||
|-|
|https://unpkg.com/@endpass/connect@latest|
|https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@latest|

or specify the version

||
|-|
|https://unpkg.com/@endpass/connect@0.22.1-beta|
|https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@0.22.1-beta|

Add script tag to you application, before any calls to Endpass connect.

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-script.md.erb" %>

After that, the Endpass connect library will be available in your js code as a root object variable. Use it as `window.EndpassConnect` or just `EndpassConnect`

Plugin for oauth will be available as `window.EndpassOauthPlugin`.

And plugin for provider usage - `window.EndpassProviderPlugin`.

### WAY 2: Modular integration

First you need to install the library through the package manager.

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_install.md.erb" %>

After that, import it into the desired file

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-module.md.erb" %>

## Creating instance

To use Endpass connect, create an instance with the constructor presented in the previous [chapter](#library-integration). Remember to pass cliends ID you recieved in the first [chapter](#application-registration) of this guide.

<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_init.md.erb" %>

## Instance usage

<%= partial "includes/connect/plugins/oauth/example/_use.md.erb" %>

You have `connect` and you are ready to get user information. Just call correct method.

For example, `connect.request('/user')` will return promise with [basic user information](#user).
