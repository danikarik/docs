# Authentication

## Application Registration

To integrate Endpass auth into your application, you first need to register it in your [Endpass dashboard](https://vault.endpass.com/#/apps).

### Required data:

|Key            |Description   |
|---------------|--------------|
|`Domain`       |The domain in which your application will be hosted|
|`RedirectUrls` |List of available redirect URLs after successful authorization|

After registration, you will receive the application client ID and client secret for future use.

<aside class="warning">
Treat your client secret like a password. It should never be used in client-side apps or exposed to the user in any way.

## Access Tokens
After registering an application, you will receive a **client id** and **client secret**.

The client ID and client secret can be used with your preferred oAuth2 client library to acquire an access token for a particular user of your application.
