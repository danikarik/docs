Connect provides Oauth authorization flow which can be used for user authentication and private [API calls](#server-api).

To implement it you first need to register you application at [Endpass-vault](https://vault.endpass.com/#/apps) and receive your clientId.

Create instance of class and use it in your application. You can know about
options and methods in the [instance methods section](#instance-methods).
