## Installation (CDN)

If you are not using a build system like Webpack in your project, you can load Endpass Connect from CDN with a script tag.


<%= partial "includes/connect/example/_import-browser-oauth.md.erb" %>

### Loading a specific version

Loading the latest library version is recommended for most use cases.
For advanced users, it is possible to specify a specific version to load in the script source.

`https://unpkg.com/@endpass/connect@0.31.0-beta`

The list of versions can be [seen on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@endpass/connect?activeTab=versions).

### Alternate CDN
If there are issues with the primary unpkg CDN, the jsdelivr CDN can also be used.

Latest version:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@latest`

Specify a version:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@endpass/connect@0.31.0-beta`
